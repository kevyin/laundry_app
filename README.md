# Laundry days

Laundry happens during the day, when the sun shines.
This app reports weather during that window of 9am-6pm

You like to hang your laundry outside: Which days have sun? Should you do your laundry before the rain starts next week?

You have solar panels: Is there atleast going to be enough sun to run the dryer?
