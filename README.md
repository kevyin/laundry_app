# Laundry days

Laundry happens during the day, when the sun shines.
This app reports weather during that window of 9am-6pm

  Which days have sun and lowest humidity? Should you do your laundry before the rain starts next week?

* You have solar panels:
  
  How cloudy will it be?, can you still run the dryer?
